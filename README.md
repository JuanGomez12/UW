Welcome to my Github! The folders are divided by the course that the work was done in, as follows:

Electrical and Computer Engineering:
 - ECE608: Quantitative Methods in Biomedical Engineering
   - Work done in R language
   - Experiment Design
   - Data analysis and visualization
   - ANOVA, pairwise testing
   
 - ECE656: Database Systems
   - Work done in SQL
   - Data Mining and Analysis using SQL Queries
   
 - ECE650: Methods and Tools for Software Engineering
   - Work done in Python and C++
   - Use of Linux commands like Pipe and Fork
   - App to calculate the best optimal camera number and position to cover each intersection of a system of streets given as coordinates. The intersections were analyzed as nodes in a graph and later converted to a system that could be input into a SAT Solver
   
 - ECE657A: Data and Knowledge Modelling and Analysis
   - Work done in Python
   - Used Pandas, numpy, Scikit-learn and Keras to solve Data knowledge questions
   - Data visualization was done using Matplotlib and Seaborn
   - Dealt with topics like data preprocessing, feature engineering, data analysis, data visualization, dimensionality reduction, cross-validation, and different Machine Learning and Deep Learnign techniques.
 
System Design:
 - SYDE675: Pattern Recognition
   - Work done in Python
   - Used Pandas, numpy and Scikit-learn to solve Data knowledge questions
   - Data visualization was done using Matplotlib and Seaborn
   - Worked on topics like data preprocessing, data analysis, data visualization, dimensionality reduction, cross-validation, and different Machine Learning techniques.
