 abstract = {This review covers computer-assisted analysis of images in the field of medical imaging. Recent advances in machine learning, especially with regard to deep learning, are helping to identify, classify, and quantify patterns in medical images. At the core of these advances is the ability to exploit hierarchical feature representations learned solely from data, instead of features designed by hand according to domain-specific knowledge. Deep learning is rapidly becoming the state of the art, leading to enhanced performance in various medical applications. We introduce the fundamentals of deep learning methods and review their successes in image registration, detection of anatomical and cellular structures, tissue segmentation, computer-aided disease diagnosis and prognosis, and so on. We conclude by discussing research issues and suggesting future directions for further improvement.},

@article{Agarwal.2015,
 abstract = {Image fusion is used to enhance the quality of images by combining two images of same scene obtained from different techniques. In medical diagnosis by combining the images obtained by Computed Tomography (CT) scan and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) we get more information and additional data from fused image. This paper presents a hybrid technique using curvelet and wavelet transform used in medical diagnosis. In this technique the image is segmented into bands using wavelet transform, the segmented image is then fused into sub bands using curvelet transform which breaks the bands into overlapping tiles and efficiently converting the curves in images using straight lines. These tiles are integrated together using inverse wavelet transform to produce a highly informative fused image. Wavelet based fusion extracts spatial details from high resolution bands but its limitation lies in the fusion of curved shapes. Therefore for better information and higher resolution on curved shapes we are blending wavelet transform with curvelet transform as we know that curvelet transform deals effectively with curves areas, corners and profiles. These two fusion techniques are extracted and then fused implementing hybrid image fusion algorithm, findings shows that fused image has minimum errors and present better quality results. The peak signal to noise ratio value for the hybrid method was higher in comparison to that of wavelet and curvelet transform fused images. Also we get improved statistics results in terms of Entropy, Peak signal to noise ratio, correlation coefficient, mutual information and edge association. This shows that the quality of fused image was better in case of hybrid method.},

The Proposed algorithm uses approximation and detailed layer fusion rules and the performance are comparing with the multi-level local extrema (MLE) method [1]. The analysis of the proposed method has been performed with several sets of medical images. The Performances of fused multi-model images can be computed using PSNR (peak signal to noise ratio), MI (mutual information) and SSIM (structural similarity index).

For the fusion of medical images that it is very helpful to medical exploration and clinical diagnosis. An image fusion method for CT and MRI medical image using nonsubsampled shearlet transform (NSST) and dictionary learning which is based on sparse representation (SR) theory is presented. NSST and dictionary learning are two most extensively used image representation theories. Firstly, the source image is decomposed by NSST to get low frequency coefficients and the high frequency coefficients. Secondly, the high frequency coefficients are merged using the absolute-maximum rule while the low frequency coefficients are fused with a SR-based fusion approach. Finally, the fused image is obtained by inverse NSST. The results show that the proposed method achieves the best performance in both subjective and objective evaluation.},

A significant task for retrieving complementary information from different modality of medical images such as MRI, CT, PET and SPECT can be achieved by multimodal medical image fusion. Different characteristics of low and high frequency sub bands are taken into account and fusion rules are applied. In the proposed method, DTCWT (Dual Tree Complex Wavelet Transform) is applied to extract salient information from each modality. Fusion rule is applied with PCA features. Performance analysis is carried out between the proposed fusion method and other existing methods. Improvement in visual quality can be seen in the proposed method.},

abstract="Image fusion refers to the techniques that integrate complementary information from multiple image sensor data such that the new images are more suitable for the purpose of human visual perception and the compute-processing tasks. In this paper, a new image fusion algorithm based on multiwavelet transform to fuse multisensor images is presented. The detailed discussions in the paper are focused on the two-wavelet and two-scaling function multiwavelets. Multiwavelets are extensions from scalar wavelet, and have several unique advantages in comparison with scalar wavelets, so that multiwavelet is employed to decompose and reconstruct images in this algorithm. In this paper, the image fusion is performed at the pixel level, other types of image fusion schemes, such as feature or decision fusion, are not considered. In this fusion algorithm, a feature-based fusion rule is used to combine original subimages and to form a pyramid for the fused image. When images are merged in multiwavelet space, different frequency ranges are processed differently. It can merge information from original images adequately and improve abilities of information analysis and feature extraction. Extensive experiments including the fusion of registered multiband SPOT multispectral XS1{\backslash}XS3 images, multifocus digital camera images, multisensor of VIS{\backslash}IR images, and medical CT{\backslash}MRI images are presented in this paper. In this paper, mutual information is employed as a means of objective assessing image fusion performance. The experiment results show that this fusion algorithm, based on multiwavelet transform, is an effective approach in image fusion area.",
